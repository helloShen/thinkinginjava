description: >
  (4) Add a class with a dispose( ) method to the previous exercise. Modify FailingConstructor so that the constructor creates one of these disposable objects as a member object, after which the constructor might throw an exception, after which it creates a second disposable member object. Write code to properly guard against failure, and in main( ) verify that all possible failure situations are covered.

```java


package com.ciaoshen.thinkinjava.chapter12;
import java.io.*;

public class Exercise23 {
    public static class FailingConstructor {
        private BufferedReader br1;
        private BufferedReader br2;
        public FailingConstructor(String path1, String path2) throws FileNotFoundException {
            br1 = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File(path1)));
            try {
                System.out.println(path1 + " opened!");
            } finally {
                try {
                    br1.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    System.out.println(path1 + " cannot be closed!");
                }
