description: >
  (1) Create an interface with two methods, and a class that implements that interface and adds another method. In another class, create a generic method with an argument type that is bounded by the interface, and show that the methods in the interface are callable inside this generic method. In main( ), pass an instance of the implementing class to the generic method.
